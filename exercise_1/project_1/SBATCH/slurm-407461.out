slurmstepd: error: *** JOB 407461 ON fat001 CANCELLED AT 2024-04-28T12:21:37 DUE TO TIME LIMIT ***
--------------------------------------------------------------------------
ORTE has lost communication with a remote daemon.

  HNP daemon   : [[16334,0],0] on node fat001
  Remote daemon: [[16334,0],1] on node fat002

This is usually due to either a failure of the TCP network
connection to the node, or possibly an internal failure of
the daemon itself. We cannot recover from this failure, and
therefore will terminate the job.
