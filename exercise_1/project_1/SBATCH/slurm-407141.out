slurmstepd: error: *** JOB 407141 ON fat001 CANCELLED AT 2024-04-27T05:43:29 DUE TO TIME LIMIT ***
--------------------------------------------------------------------------
ORTE has lost communication with a remote daemon.

  HNP daemon   : [[46930,0],0] on node fat001
  Remote daemon: [[46930,0],1] on node fat002

This is usually due to either a failure of the TCP network
connection to the node, or possibly an internal failure of
the daemon itself. We cannot recover from this failure, and
therefore will terminate the job.
