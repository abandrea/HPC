    "* Algorithm: the algorithm used to perform the broadcast operation (pipeline, chain, basic_linear);\n",
    "* Processes: the nummber of processes (from 2 to 32, since in partition we have setted ) used to perform for each size of the messages (from 2 byte to 1038576 byte, that corresponds to 1MB);\n",
    "* Size: the size of the message in Bytes;\n",
    "* Latency: the latency of the broadcast operation in microseconds.\n",

    "\n",
    "The objective is to analyse the collected data and compare the baseline algorithm (basic_linear) with the other two algorithms (chain and pipeline), trying also to understand/infer the performance model behind the algorithms, taking into account the architecture on which they are being executed.
